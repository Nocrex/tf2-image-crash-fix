 /* png_info is a structure that holds the information in a PNG file so
 * that the application can find out the characteristics of the image.
 * If you are reading the file, this structure will tell you what is
 * in the PNG file.  If you are writing the file, fill in the information
 * you want to put into the PNG file, using png_set_*() functions, then
 * call png_write_info().
 *
 * The names chosen should be very close to the PNG specification, so
 * consult that document for information about the meaning of each field.
 *
 * With libpng < 0.95, it was only possible to directly set and read the
 * the values in the png_info_struct, which meant that the contents and
 * order of the values had to remain fixed.  With libpng 0.95 and later,
 * however, there are now functions that abstract the contents of
 * png_info_struct from the application, so this makes it easier to use
 * libpng with dynamic libraries, and even makes it possible to use
 * libraries that don't have all of the libpng ancillary chunk-handing
 * functionality.  In libpng-1.5.0 this was moved into a separate private
 * file that is not visible to applications.
 *
 * The following members may have allocated storage attached that should be
 * cleaned up before the structure is discarded: palette, trans, text,
 * pcal_purpose, pcal_units, pcal_params, hist, iccp_name, iccp_profile,
 * splt_palettes, scal_unit, row_pointers, and unknowns.   By default, these
 * are automatically freed when the info structure is deallocated, if they were
 * allocated internally by libpng.  This behavior can be changed by means
 * of the png_data_freer() function.
 *
 * More allocation details: all the chunk-reading functions that
 * change these members go through the corresponding png_set_*
 * functions.  A function to clear these members is available: see
 * png_free_data().  The png_set_* functions do not depend on being
 * able to point info structure members to any of the storage they are
 * passed (they make their own copies), EXCEPT that the png_set_text
 * functions use the same storage passed to them in the text_ptr or
 * itxt_ptr structure argument, and the png_set_rows and png_set_unknowns
 * functions do not make their own copies.
